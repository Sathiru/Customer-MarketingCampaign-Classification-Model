## Problem Definition:
The purpose of this classification model is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

## Purpose:
- Can be used in any financial service sector to support marketing campaign.

## Datasets:
**train.csv:** Each row represents an observation for each individual campaign and the customer response. The dataset contains 15 columns and 32950 observations.

dayofweek:	last contact day of the week ('mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')

duration:	last contact duration, in seconds . Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no')

campaign:	number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (includes last contact)

pdays:	number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (999 means client was not previously contacted)

previous:	number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client

poutcome:	outcome of the previous marketing campaign ('failure','nonexistent','success')

Target variable:- y	binary	has the client subscribed a term deposit? ('yes','no')

## Data Preprocessing:

**Cleaning and Explanatory Data Analysis**

Checked for null values.

Checked for duplicate values, Deleted the 8 duplicated rows.

Checked for the distribution of target variable, where the target variable is highly imbalance.

|  | Count | 	% |
| no |	29230 |	0.887317 |

Performed explanatory data analysis to learn more about the relation between each feature and the target variable,

Oil, web and finance industry seems to have higher salary

## Feature Engineering:

Performed one-hot encoding for nominal categorical variable like jobType, major and industry and performed label encoding for degree, used the educational level for labeling eventhough it is not a typical ordinal variable.

### Checked for correlation:

Most of the features are positively correlated with the target variable salary and they is no evidence of muticollinearlity of correlation > 0.9, whereas milesFromMetropolis is negatively correlated with Salary.
